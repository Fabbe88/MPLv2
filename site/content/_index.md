blurb:
  heading: What is Multimedial Project Logging?
  text: Multimedial Project Logging (MPL) is a new form of publishing digital
    content. The creator has the possibility of combining two or more data
    formats in a visually appealing and comprehensible way to transport more
    information without confusing the viewer.
intro:
  heading: Data Formats
  text: At the moment, this site is publishing various projects that have been
    logged by different data formats. The goal is to test the practicability of
    this approach for both the creators and the viewers. Mainly, two
    combinations of data types are currently being featured.
data formats:

    text: Video & GPS Data: combining video file formats, such as .mp4 with
      geolocation data, such as .gpx allows for a synchronized view of the
      creator's camera and his or her location on a map. Both media files are
      played simultaneously within one CSS module.

      fall in love with in our shop.
software tools:
  heading: Software Tools
  text: The creator's workflow depends on hardware to collect the data, software
    and hardware to read and edit the data and web applications that run on the
    webserver to build the site and display the data streams correctly. Read
