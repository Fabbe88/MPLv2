blurb:
  heading: What is Multimedial Project Logging?
  text: Multimedial Project Logging (MPL) is a new form of publishing digital
    content. The creator has the possibility of combining two or more data
    formats in a visually appealing and comprehensible way to transport more
    information without confusing the viewer.
intro:
  heading: Data Formats
  text: At the moment, this site is publishing various projects that have been
    logged by different data formats. The goal is to test the practicability of
    this approach for both the creators and the viewers. Mainly, two
    combinations of data types are currently being featured.
data formats:

    text: We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from
      independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a variety
      of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and local
      communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
      availability.

    text: We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
      tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
      own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget to
      fall in love with in our shop.

  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
